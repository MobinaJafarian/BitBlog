Although all of these sites have incredible value, Instagram is one of the largest. Instagram is more than just a social media site, it is a place of business. With over 800 million monthly users, there is a massive opportunity to market to youth and adults around the world. However, there are some tips and tricks you&rsquo;ll need to know before diving into Instagram. This guide will walk you through the essentials of using <a href=\"https://www.republictitle.com/2019/06/10/instagram-for-business/\">Instagram for business</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Ways to Master Instagram for Business\" src=\"https://askaaronlee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blur-electronics-hand-174938.jpg\" style=\"height:480px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Business Account</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are over 25 million businesses already on Instagram, and it is a good idea to join their ranks. The best way to set your company apart from the typical user it by creating a business account. This type of account comes with analytic capabilities to help you monitor your account.The data that is presented includes the number of interactions, profile visits, and website clicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business accounts also come with the option to &ldquo;boost&rdquo; content. This is an inexpensive, paid promotion program that ensures you are seen by a larger audience. If you already have a basic Instagram account, you can easily <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/502981923235522\">switch it to a business</a> account.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tracking Link</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram allows a profile to post a single link in their bio and nowhere else. You cannot post a link in a post or anywhere else on your account. Since you are only allowed one link, might as well make it count and use a tracking link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tracking link is a link that redirects to the page of your choosing, usually your company site. Tracking links collect data such as website pages, blog posts, links on social media, links on ads, and emails. These links can be used anywhere around the Internet, especially in Instagram bios. Do keep in mind that most of Instagram is accessed on mobile devices so make your link mobile friendly. Nothing will make a viewer hit the back button than a poorly optimized mobile site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pictures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The base of every Instagram account, normal or business, is pictures. Everyone wants to see beautiful well shot pictures and that is especially true for business accounts. People expect businesses to have more resources than the average Instagram user. This means your business pictures need to be professionally done. Do not skimp on pictures, if your picture is poor no one will read your captions or click on your link. Take advantage of natural light, don&rsquo;t overexpose your photos, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hashtags</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://askaaronlee.com/getting-the-most-out-of-social-media-campaign/\">Hashtags</a> are a powerful and necessary tool. Using them correctly can net you a larger audience and more engagement. However, using them too much can lead to negative consequences. When you use too many tags, you can become shadowbanned. Your posts will still be viewable and people can still interact with them, but they will be much less prominent. This is because Instagram doesn&rsquo;t want people to game the hashtag system by filling their captions with tags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say using a handful of tags is bad, just keep it to tags that absolutely must be there and leave the extras behind. You can use branded tags that directly relate to your business to connect your content back to your brand. Community tags are more general words or phrases that connect users who search for themes. Try searching for tags to help find content that follows your company&rsquo;s theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Live Streaming</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Live streaming is a good way to connect with customers face-to-face and in real-time. You can show behind the scenes projects, preview new products, or answer questions from customers. It is a good idea to have the host of the livestream be a face of the company so customers can associate that person with your brand. Furthermore, these streams can be found in your stories for 24 hours after they end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stories</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories are a great way to do quick and temporary content. The pictures or videos you post on stories disappear after 24 hours, creating an area of Instagram that rewards loyal followers by showing them limited time content. You can advertise limited time sales or promotions on your story, as well as behind the scenes content that shows another side to your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram is a powerful tool for business. Your company can reach millions of potential customers when you use the system correctly. Furthermore, be sure to use a business account to gain access to tracking features that are sure to make your life easier.

It&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ll know what they&rsquo;re doing well and what areas need improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Feedback isn&rsquo;t effective if it&rsquo;s only given once in a while. To really help your team grow, you need to give feedback on a regular basis. This could be daily, weekly, or even monthly, depending on the situation. An <a href=\"https://www.motivosity.com/\">employee engagement platform</a> would work well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Encourage learning.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best ways to develop your employees is to encourage them to learn new things. This could mean taking on new assignments, attending training courses, or even just reading industry-related articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Encouraging learning shows your employees that you&rsquo;re invested in their development and want them to grow in their careers. It also helps them stay up-to-date on industry trends and developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Provide opportunities for growth.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to encouraging learning, you should also provide opportunities for your employees to grow in their careers. This could involve giving them more responsibility, offering promotions, or providing mentorship programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your employees the opportunity to grow shows that you&rsquo;re committed to their development and want them to progress in their careers. It can also help retention, as employees are more likely to stay with a company that offers opportunities for advancement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Give them autonomy.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set clear expectations and provide guidance, you also need to give your employees some degree of autonomy. This means letting them make decisions, solve problems, and take the initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your employees autonomy shows trust and helps them develop their decision-making and problem-solving skills. It also allows them to take ownership of their work and feel more invested in their jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Be a role model.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a leader, you need to be a role model for your team. This means living up to the standards you set for them and setting an example in your own behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a role model helps your employees see the importance of developing themselves and sets the tone for the kind of behavior you expect from them. It also helps build trust and respect between you and your team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Celebrate successes.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t forget to celebrate your team&rsquo;s successes along the way. This could involve giving out awards, throwing a party, or simply acknowledging their achievements in a meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celebrating successes is important because it shows your employees that you appreciate their hard work. It also motivates them to keep up the good work and continue striving for excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing your employees doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated or expensive. By following these seven simple steps, you can start making a difference in your team&rsquo;s development today.</p>\r\n', 8, 10, '/assets/images/posts/2022_10_30_00_02_18.png', '2022-10-29 12:18:35', '2022-10-29 15:02:18'),
(9, '5 Reasons To Update Your Office Building', '<p>If you work in an office, there&rsquo;s a good chance that your building needs some updates. Many office buildings are outdated and not very functional. If you&rsquo;re looking to update your office building, here are five reasons why you should do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Give Your Building A Facelift</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any business owner knows that first impressions are essential. When customers or clients walk into your building, you want them to be impressed by its cleanliness, layout, and overall appearance. Regular updates to your building can go a long way toward achieving this goal. For example, installing new <a href=\"https://blog.manningtoncommercial.com/resilient-sheet-vs-luxury-vinyl-tile-infection-control\">vinyl flooring sheets</a> is a cost-effective way to give your space a fresh, modern look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will improve the look of your building, but it will also make it easier to keep clean. In addition, regular updates send the message that you are invested in your business and take pride in its appearance. As a result, making updates regularly is an essential part of maintaining a professional image.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Functionality Is Key</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to making your building look nicer, updates can also make it more functional. This is especially important if you have an older building that wasn&rsquo;t designed with today&rsquo;s technology in mind. For example, adding new outlets and wiring can accommodate the ever-growing number of electronic devices people use in the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Updating your building&rsquo;s HVAC system is another way to improve its functionality. Older HVAC systems are often inefficient and expensive to operate. Replacing an old system with a newer, more energy-efficient model can help you save money on utility bills and make your space more comfortable for employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Make Your Employees More Productive</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that happy employees are more productive employees. If your building is outdated and not very functional, it can harm employee morale. Making regular updates will show your employees that you care about their comfort and well-being, making them more likely to be engaged in their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, improving the functionality of your building can directly impact employee productivity. For example, if your HVAC system isn&rsquo;t working correctly, it can make it difficult for employees to focus on their work. By making updates that improve the function of your office, you can create a better work environment for your employees and help them be more productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Attract New Tenants or Customers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you own an office building that you lease out to other businesses, it&rsquo;s essential to make regular updates to keep your tenants happy. Tenants are always looking for spaces that are well-maintained and up-to-date. If your building requires repairs or updates, it&rsquo;s likely that tenants will be less satisfied with their area and may be more likely to move to a different location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, making regular updates can also help you attract new tenants or customers. When people are looking for office space, they often choose buildings that look modern and well-cared-for. You can make your building more appealing to potential tenants and customers by investing in regular updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Increase the Value of Your Property</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alankohll/2019/01/24/how-your-office-space-impacts-employee-wellbeing/\">making regular updates to your office building</a> can help increase its value. If you&rsquo;re thinking about selling your property, potential buyers will be more interested in an up-to-date and well-maintained building. In addition, making updates can also help you get a higher price for your property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in regular updates is an essential part of maintaining the value of your office building. By keeping your building up-to-date, you can ensure that it retains its value over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, there are many reasons to update your office building regularly. From improving its appearance to increasing its value, making regular updates is essential for responsible business owners. Investing in regular updates will pay off in the long run and help ensure that your business is booming.</p>\r\n', 8, 10, '/assets/images/posts/2022_10_30_00_04_24.jpg', '2022-10-29 12:30:43', '2022-10-29 15:04:24'),
(10, 'iPhone 13 vs iPhone 14: What Are the Differences?', '<p>About 60% of people in the U.S. use some kind of iPhone. Apple is the clear market leader for smartphones, and the iPhone 14 is their newest addition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you considering picking up a new iPhone? Are you trying to decide between the iPhone 13 vs iPhone 14? Let&#39;s talk about it! Read on to learn about a few differences between these 2 phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is often the most important factor in people&#39;s minds when they&#39;re considering a new phone. How does the iPhone 13 compare to the iPhone 14 when it comes to price?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iPhone 13</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 13 price starts at $799 and goes up to $1,099, but this varies depending on your carrier and whether you buy new or used. If you buy a used iPhone, you can save hundreds of dollars. This isn&#39;t the case when you buy a brand new iPhone 14 (but you may be able to get discounts on the 14 if you exchange your phone).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iPhone 14</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 14 price also starts at $799 but the higher-price models go up to $1,599. Of course, this price will still depend on your carrier and you can get a discount if you trade in your current phone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The base price of the basic version of this iPhone is the same as the iPhone 13, so if you&#39;re buying a new phone, it may be worthwhile to get the newer version.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What types of features do you want your phone to have? Here are a few that you can expect from each phone. <a href=\"https://www.i-blason.com/blogs/news/the-features-that-set-the-iphone-14-pro-apart\" target=\"_blank\">This helpful article</a> can break them down further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iPhone 13</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 13 is splash, water, and dust-resistant. It has a large retina display (the sizes vary depending on the model you choose). It also has FaceID for extra security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has a 4-core GPU and 4GB of memory to start. It also has a helpful emergency SOS feature (that also came with other older models).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iPhone 14</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 14 has everything that the iPhone 13 has and then some.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It added an interesting extra safety feature: crash detection. While this feature isn&#39;t perfect, it does have the ability to contact emergency services if the phone &quot;thinks&quot; you&#39;ve experienced a crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has 6GB of memory and a 5-core GPU.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also has a special <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/809377/what-is-vapor-chamber-cooling/\" target=\"_blank\">vapor chamber cooling system</a>. No more phones that overheat while you&#39;re trying to use them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camera</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all love our fancy cell phone cameras. iPhone cameras have been good for a while now, so how does the new version compare?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iPhone 13</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 13 main camera is 12 megapixels with an &fnof;/1.6 aperture. The front &quot;selfie&quot; camera is also 12 megapixels but with an &fnof;/2.2 aperture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It offers a cinematic mode for videos at 1080p and 30 fps. It also has a basic dual-camera system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iPhone 14</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been a few modifications made to the iPhone camera for the iPhone 14.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, while both cameras are still 12 megapixels, the normal one has an &fnof;/1.5 aperture and the front camera has an &fnof;/1.9 aperture. This will make a large difference for selfies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cinematic mode has also been upgraded to 4k HDR.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iPhone 13 vs iPhone 14: Which Is Right for You?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are only a few differences between the iPhone 13 vs iPhone 14.

(11, 'A Quick Guide to the Perfect LinkedIn Photo', '<p>If you want the best business and career opportunities to come your way, you&rsquo;ll need to make a great first impression. One of the best ways to do that is through a well-made website build to support your personal brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another excellent way to make a positive first impression on your audience is through your LinkedIn profile. Whether you already have a LinkedIn account or you&rsquo;re looking to create a new one, you&rsquo;ll want to make it as interesting as possible. Among other things, this means having a top-notch LinkedIn photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This LinkedIn photo guide will tell you all you need to know about creating the perfect LinkedIn profile picture and how to stand out from other applicants at first glance. Let&rsquo;s dive right in!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A Quick Guide to the Perfect LinkedIn Photo\" src=\"https://askaaronlee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/greg-bulla-DuA2f9jNoD8-unsplash.jpg\" style=\"height:179px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Important Is a Picture on LinkedIn?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In a world ruled by Zoom meetings and social media interactions, it is a good idea to remind people that behind your online persona, there is a living, breathing individual. LinkedIn itself says that having a profile photo dramatically improves your chances of getting noticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On average, profiles with photos receive nine times more connection requests and as many as <a href=\"https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/march/14/linkedin-profile-photo-tips-introducing-photo-filters-and-editing\">21 times</a> more profile views.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Kind of Photo Should I Use for LinkedIn?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As obvious as this may sound, your photo should reflect what you look like in real life. You&rsquo;ve probably had the experience of running into a person you had previously only seen on social media, only to find that they look nothing like their online photos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can leave a bad taste in your mouth, and you may even question the person&rsquo;s credibility, and that is definitely bad for business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if there&rsquo;s one piece of advice that we can give you about what kind of photo to use on LinkedIn, it is this &mdash; use an up-to-date profile picture that reflects your day-to-day appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Get a Good LinkedIn Photo?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people choose to enlist the help of professional photographers for their LinkedIn photos. While there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with that approach, chances are you can snap some pics of your own that would work just as well. You&rsquo;ll just need to be mindful of a few things, such as your equipment (smartphone or dedicated camera), background, lighting, and wardrobe options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to creating a high-quality headshot, location is a crucial factor, not only in terms of the look of the background but also your mood. A relaxing and comfortable location will help you appear more welcoming, for example. Here are a few helpful tips on capturing a top-notch LinkedIn photo:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Minimize headwear, accessories, and jewelry</li>\r\n	<li>Make eye contact with the camera</li>\r\n	<li>Smile with your eyes</li>\r\n	<li>Choose colors that complement your skin tone and hair</li>\r\n	<li>Pick clothes that flatter your body style</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Be prepared to take lots of photos. Chances are, you will not be happy with the first few attempts unless you have a lot of modeling experience. Patience is your friend here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Best Poses for LinkedIn Photos</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we mentioned above, you&rsquo;ll probably need to take lots of photos before you get the one you&rsquo;re happy with. That&rsquo;s fine. A high-quality LinkedIn Photo will be worth the effort. Here are a few <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinryan/2021/03/09/linkedin-photo-tips-to-look-your-best-instead-of-unprofessional-or-old/?sh=5fbbc9cd4c02\">poses and technical tips</a> to help you along:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If you choose to sit, face the camera directly and smile</li>\r\n	<li>Capture mid-chest up or waist-up</li>\r\n	<li>If you choose to stand, place one foot slightly in front of the other and stand at a 45-degree angle</li>\r\n	<li>Use a solid single-tone background, but avoid white</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid fluorescent lighting, shadows, and direct sunlight</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>LinkedIn Cover Photo Size</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your cover image and profile photo must combine into a unified whole. Think about how the two play together. In terms of size, LinkedIn has a clear set of specifications for each image, including the cover photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"LinkedIn Cover Photo Size\" src=\"https://askaaronlee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-11-at-12.19.09-PM.png\" style=\"height:584px; width:1414px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Source: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/70781/image-specifications-for-your-linkedin-pages-and-career-pages?lang=en\">LinkedIn</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Add a Photo on LinkedIn?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so you&rsquo;ve completed the photo session, picked out your favorite snapshot, made sure it fits all the relevant criteria, and you&rsquo;re finally ready to upload. But how do you do that? Don&rsquo;t worry; adding, changing, deleting, and editing your LinkedIn photo is quite simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All you need to do is navigate to your profile through the Me icon at the top of the homepage. From there, click on your existing profile photo or the Camera icon that substitutes it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll be presented with a pop-up window allowing you to upload the photo from your device. Just follow the on-screen prompts, cropping, adjusting, or changing the size/position of your profile picture. Once you&rsquo;re happy with the results, click Save photo, and you&rsquo;re done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Change a LinkedIn Cover Photo?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Changing your cover photo is a similar process. You&rsquo;ll be navigating to your profile through the Me icon again and clicking on your background photo. You can choose to Reposition, Delete, or Change the image from here. Once you&rsquo;re finished, click Apply, then Save.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Change Cover Photo in LinkedIn App?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Things are not much different in the LinkedIn App either, except instead of clicking, you&rsquo;ll be tapping the buttons on the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reach your profile, all you need to do is tap your profile photo. From there, you can tap the cover image and choose the Camera icon to take a new picture or upload an image from your device&rsquo;s library. Click Save when you&rsquo;re done, and your new cover photo is ready to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Delete a LinkedIn Photo?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you wish to delete your profile pic or your cover photo, all you need to do is follow the steps outlined above (both on desktop and in the mobile app). Once you&rsquo;re in your profile, all you need to do is tap/click on the image you would like to remove and hit Delete. It is as easy as 1-2-3.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is It Appropriate to Use a Selfie as a LinkedIn Profile Picture?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking your profile picture with a cellphone is perfectly fine. Photos taken on today&rsquo;s smartphones are becoming indistinguishable from those taken using professional cameras, so you should have no problems in terms of picture quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, if you want to stay in line with the <a href=\"https://www.designrush.com/agency/logo-branding/trends/best-corporate-branding-examples\">best company branding</a> advice and appear trustworth and professional, you should probably avoid using a selfie as your LinkedIn photo. If you can&rsquo;t get a family member or friend to take the picture for you, there&rsquo;s the option of setting the phone against a piece of furniture or using a tripod if you happen to have one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Can I Effectively Use LinkedIn to Build my Personal Brand?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your LinkedIn profile is the best way to make a great first impression with a potential employer or business associate. As important as a top-notch profile picture is, it is only the beginning. You&rsquo;ll need to create a LinkedIn presence that speaks to your audience; otherwise, you will not get their attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since a great LinkedIn profile can be the difference between being overlooked by prospective employers and landing the opportunity of your dreams, we recommend taking the time to set it up properly. To help you do this, we&rsquo;ve created a LinkedIn Profile Guide, so we recommend that you check it out.</p>\r\n', 2, 10, '/assets/images/posts/2022_10_29_22_27_18.jpg', '2022-10-29 13:22:10', '2022-10-29 13:27:18');
